# spacemacs-evil-keys package

Adds sequence-style key-bindings with space as the leader key for a bunch of commands. These are based on and, where possible, identical to the default evil mode key-bindings found in spacemacs.

This package includes key-bindings for various built in atom operations and for some third party plugins that I use. (Most of which are by the marvellous [t9md](https://atom.io/users/t9md))

* vim-mode-plus
* atom-fuzzy-grep
* atom-ctags
* cursor-history
* recent-finder
* git-plus
